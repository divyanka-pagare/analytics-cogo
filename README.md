what is invoice ?

An invoice is a commercial document that a seller provides to a buyer, formally requesting payment for goods or services rendered. It details the transaction, including the items sold, their prices, and the total amount due, along with payment terms and other relevant information. In essence, it's a bill that outlines the financial obligations of the buyer.
